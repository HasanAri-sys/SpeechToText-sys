# SpeechToText-sys
An attempt at making a program which recognizes speech and can copy phrases and letters down.

This is an idea I've had for some time, in which a python program can "listen" to mp3 files and recognize spoken letters and words.
It might take a long time to finish, but I'm pretty hopeful and ambitious, so we'll see where that gets me :>
